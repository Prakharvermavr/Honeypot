# Honeypot Overview

## Honeypot

A honeypot is a security mechanism designed to lure cyber attackers by mimicking a legitimate system, application, or network service. Its primary goal is to attract attackers and study their behavior to gain insights into their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Honeypots are often used to detect and analyze unauthorized access attempts and collect data on malicious activities.

### How Honeypots Work:

- **Deception:** Honeypots simulate a real system that appears vulnerable to attackers.
- **Monitoring:** Once an attacker interacts with the honeypot, their actions are monitored and logged without alerting them.
- **Data Collection:** All activities, including login attempts, commands executed, and data accessed, are recorded for analysis.
- **Analysis:** Security researchers analyze the collected data to understand attack patterns and develop better defenses.

## DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)

A DMZ is a physical or logical subnet that separates an internal network from an untrusted network, such as the internet. It contains public-facing services and servers, adding an extra layer of security by isolating these systems from the internal network.

### Importance in Honeypots:

- **Isolation:** Placing honeypots in the DMZ ensures they are isolated from the internal network, minimizing the risk if the honeypot is compromised.
- **Visibility:** Honeypots in the DMZ are more likely to be targeted by attackers, as they appear as publicly accessible services.
- **Data Collection:** The DMZ setup allows for effective monitoring and logging of attacker interactions with the honeypot without compromising internal systems.
